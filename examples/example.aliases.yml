#
# Example Drush alias file for multiple sites.
#
# Each site may have multiple "environments"
# such as "development", "test" and "production".
# The top-level element names the environment.
#
# An environment named "common" will be unioned
# with all other environments defined in the file.
#
# See "example.alias.yml" for a description of
# the options that may appear in each site environment.
