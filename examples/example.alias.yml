#
# Example Drush alias file for a single site 'example'.
#
# Each site may have multiple "environments"
# such as "development", "test" and "production".
# The top-level element names the environment.
#
# An environment named "common" will be unioned
# with all other environments defined in the file.
#
# This file is equivalent to *.alias.drushrc.php,
# except it allows for multiple environments for every
# site.  Existing *.alias.drushrc.php files are
# loaded with all options in "common".
